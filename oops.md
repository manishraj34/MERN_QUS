# What is OOP?

- Object-oriented programming (OOP) is about crating objects that contain both data and function.

- OOP provides a clear structure for the programs.

- OOP helps to keep the java code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug.


# [Object Oriented Programming With Real world Example](https://fdhgjhjhukj.medium.com/object-oriented-programming-with-real-world-example-63f69f917d62)

Basically why we are write coding ,to solve our real world problem right. In OOP a logic is right base on the object with this features
1.abstraction
2.encapsulation
3.inheritance
4.polymorphism

- There are a lot of Car,bike,ATM and coffee machine.and there brands and name also different. In OOP those are called object .

- Objects logic are done by classes and Class is a blue print of Object. for example ,by phone we can call,Bluetooth ,take photo etc. those every logic will be divide as classes.

# [Why Study Oops ?](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/forums/why-we-need-oops-in-programming-language)

- **Why we need OOPs in Programming language?**

- OOP helps to keep the JAVA code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself"
- OOPs provides code reusability which reduce the duplication of code because once you have duplicate code, you have make changes everywhere which leads to performance.
- Code can be changed anytime as per our requirement  in the application, OOPs makes it easier.


#  Disadvantages of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- **Larger program size:** Object-oriented programs typically involve **more lines of code than procedural programs.**

- **Slower programs:** Object-oriented programs are typically slower than procedure-based programs, as they typically require **more instructions to be executed.**

- **Not suitable for all types of problems:** The problems like functional-programming style, logic-programming style, or procedure-based programming style, and applying object-oriented programming in those situations will not result in efficient programs.


# when we say X is oop language. what dose it mean ?

- If a language is designed with the facilities specifically to support object-oriented programming having 4 features that is abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism then it is an Object-oriented programming language.
-  It's the code that is object-oriented not the language.
